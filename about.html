## About

I'm Jia Zhizhong, born in Wuhu City, Anhui Province. Studied in School of Computer Science & engineering in Southest University from September 2009 to July 2016. I like reading, coding what I interested in and playing tennis. When I were an university student, I used to sell, rent tennis racket and found a tennis club which called *WangDongQingChun which provided free tennis teaching. I also built a tennis website called  <a href="http://tenniser.sinaapp.com" target="_blank">University Tennis Union</a> and got two campus tennis champions. These experience in university make me feel happy.
